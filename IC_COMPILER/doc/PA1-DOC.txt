Summery: in this exercise we implemented lexical analysis to the IC language.

			Class hierarchy, a brief descriptions of the major classes
the project consists of 
A IC.Parser package ,in charge of parsing an input file, in our case preforming lexical analysis. 
The parser consists of:
>IC.lex
	in IC.Parser package is to be used by the Jflex tool to create the file lexer.java,
	where it is use to parse the input file into tokens 
>sym.java
	in IC.Parser is a class implementing the different Token ID's and converting a Token Type to string.
>Token.java
	in IC.Parser is a class implementing a single Token, inheriting from the Symbol class
>LexicalError.java
	in IC.Parser is a class handling a printing lexical analysis errors

in the IC package we have 
>Compiler.java,
	in IC is the main executable file  running the Main procedure
