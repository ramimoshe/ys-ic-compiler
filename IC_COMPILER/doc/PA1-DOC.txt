Exercise 1
=================================

Summary: In this exercise we implemented lexical analysis to the IC language.

Class hierarchy: a brief descriptions of the major classes
===============

The project consists of a IC.Parser package, in charge of parsing an input
file, in our case performing lexical analysis. 

The parser consists of:
>IC.lex
	in IC.Parser package is to be used by the Jflex tool to create the file Lexer.java,
	where it is use to parse the input file into tokens.
>sym.java
	in IC.Parser: a class implementing the different Token ID's and converting
	a Token Type to string.
>Token.java
	in IC.Parser: a class implementing a single Token, inheriting from the Symbol
	class.
>LexicalError.java
	in IC.Parser: a class handling printing lexical analysis errors

in the IC package we have 
>Compiler.java
	in IC package: the main file running the Main procedure, 
	in this as printing to the screen the token description.
	The tokens are printed in the flowing format:
		LINE: ID(VALUE)
	If the value of a token is a constant than its value (ergo "(VALUE)")
	will not be printed	.

Testing Strategy
================
Testing was done as part of the development strategy, 
As every part of the lexer was implemented, it was test separately.   
In addition whole programs in IC language were parsed and diff-ed
against expected results.
We used the supplied programs and compared with the supplied output,
and in addition did our own test cases (as you can see in test/ directory).

IC.lex: detailed documentation
==============================
The lexer identifies the tokens. In addition, it identifies comments.
Everything which is not a recognized token raises a LexicalError.

The tokens consist of the easy stuff (their regular expressions
are not mentioned because they are trivial):
  - Punctuation marks ()[]{};.,
  - Keywords (as in the spec)
  - Operators: binary / unary / conditionals / assignment

..and the more complicated stuff:

Quotes
------
We've implemented a single regex that captures the quote with the text inside it, 
according to the specs.

  VALID_ASCII_CHARS = [ !#-\[\]-~]
  VALID_STRING_CHARS = "\\\\"|"\\\""|"\\t"|"\\n"|{VALID_ASCII_CHARS}

VALID_ASCII_CHARS are: ASCII chars 32 - 126, except \ and ". Additionally,
'\\', '\n', '\t' and '\"' are valid.

So, finally, this is the regex for quotes:

QUOTED_STRING = [\"]({VALID_STRING_CHARS})*[\"]


Integer literal
---------------

  DIGIT = [0-9]
  INTEGER_LITERAL = [0]|[1-9]({DIGIT})*

A number can't have trailing zeros, so it is either 'zero' or it starts with a
different digit and then has any combination of trailing digits. 


Identifier
----------
Starts with a lower-case letter, then any combination of alpha-numeric characters.

  LOWER_LETTER = [a-z]
  UPPER_LETTER = [A-Z]
  LETTER = {LOWER_LETTER}|{UPPER_LETTER}|[_]
  ALPHA_NUMERIC = {DIGIT}|{LETTER}
  IDENTIFIER = {LOWER_LETTER}({ALPHA_NUMERIC})*

Class identifier
----------------
  CLASS_IDENTIFIER = {UPPER_LETTER}({ALPHA_NUMERIC})*
