compilation project documentation:exercise 1;
in this exercise we implemented  lexical analysis to the IC language
the project consists of 
A IC.package Parser,in charge of parsing an input file, in our case preforming lexical analysis. 
The parser consists of 
IC.lex
sym.java
Token.java
LexicalError.java

And a main executable file Compiler.java, running the Main procedure


>IC.lex in IC.Parser package is to be used by the Jflex tool to create the file lexer.java,
where it is use to parse the input file into tokens 
>sym.java in IC.Parser is a class implementing the different Token ID's and converting a Token Type to string.
>Token.java in IC.Parser is a class implementing a single Token, inheriting from the Symbol class
>LexicalError.java in IC.Parser is a class handling a printing lexical analysis errors
